passbrains Sandbox test cycles provide you with an opportunity to gain experience and practice how to become a successful crowdtester! You will familiarize with the passbrains platform and learn how to report valuable issues. By actively participating in this project you will earn qualification credits, we call these Career Credit Points (CCP). CCP is your qualification and performance score with passbrains. This first training and qualification exercise - they call it a “Sandbox project” - is very similar to regular client projects for which you will be eligible to be invited once you have reached the required CCP level.
They are not looking at the quantity of your issue reports at all. Reporting a large number of tickets isn't the goal of this test, they are looking for high quality tickets.
Here's what you should focus on during your tests:
Navigation - Verify if the navigation works correctly and if all links to other pages or sites work correctly.
Content - Verify if the content is properly displayed and readable.
Multimedia - Verify if graphical content, photos and videos on the site are loaded smoothly and displayed correctly.
Social Media - Verify if social media functions offered on the website properly allow to share the content with others.
Forms - Test the user interface of the various data entry forms you will find on the website, but do not actually send the form.
Search - Verify that correct results will be shown when you enter a search item, and that the correct page or site will load upon clicking on a search result.

The following goals should be achieved in this test cycle:
• identify functional issues and bugs on the website
• identify usability issues on the website
• validate compatibility with different devices and operating systems
• identify typos and incorrect grammar used
