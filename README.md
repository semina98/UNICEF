passbrains Sandbox test cycles provide you with an opportunity to gain experience and practice how to become a successful crowdtester! You will familiarize with the passbrains platform and learn how to report valuable issues. By actively participating in this project you will earn qualification credits, we call these Career Credit Points (CCP). CCP is your qualification and performance score with passbrains. This first training and qualification exercise - we call it a “Sandbox project” - is very similar to regular client projects for which you will be eligible to be invited once you have reached the required CCP level
